## 🎯 **Aim**
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be used to create structured content such as reports, articles, case studies, and creative works using ChatGPT or similar AI models.  
The goal is to show how different prompt structures influence the quality, coherence, and creativity of AI-generated content.

## 🧠 **Procedure**

### **1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns**
Understand the following prompt methods:

- **Query Decomposition:** Break complex queries into smaller parts.  
- **Decision Making:** Ask the model to choose between options.  
- **Answer Engineering:** Provide structured instructions for organized output.  
- **Fact Check List:** Ensure factual accuracy for reports/case studies.  
- **Tail Generation:** Extend narrative/story logically.  
- **Menu Actions:** Present choices and let the AI pick.  
- **Semantic Filtering:** Control tone, writing style, or accuracy.

---

### **2. Choosing the Content Type**
Select the type of content to generate:

- **Reports** – Industry analysis, sustainability reports  
- **Case Studies** – Business or tech success stories  
- **Articles** – Opinion, educational, informative  
- **Creative Content** – Comic scripts, short stories, sci-fi, etc.

Example choices:  
- Business market trend report  
- Startup case study  
- Sci-fi short story  
- Climate-change article  

---

### **3. Creating the Prompts**
- Start with a **basic prompt** to generate an initial draft.  
- Add complexity using:
  - Decision-making
  - Tail generation
  - Semantic filters  
  - Formatting instructions  

This helps in improving structure, detail, and clarity.

---

### **4. Generating & Refining Outputs**
Use iterative prompting:

- **Reports:** Start with raw data → ask for analysis → ask for insights  
- **Creative content:** Start with a story idea → add characters, conflict, location, style  
- **Case studies:** Begin with a scenario → refine with problems, solutions, and outcomes  

Continue refining until the desired quality is achieved.

---

### **5. Review and Evaluation**
Evaluate generated outputs based on:

- **Coherence:** Logical flow and organization  
- **Creativity:** Originality and engagement  
- **Accuracy:** Factual correctness  
- **Tone & Style:** Consistency with intended purpose (formal, casual, creative)
